In this hands-on seminar we present a new open-source Python 2.7 package for quantum dynamics of many-body spin chains based on exact diagonalisation. The package is well-suited to study, among others, quantum quenches at finite and infinite times, the Eigenstate Thermalisation hypothesis, many-body localisation and other dynamical phase transitions, periodically-driven (Floquet) systems, adiabatic and counter-diabatic ramps, and spin-photon interactions. We explain how to use this tool using three detailed examples: (i) adiabatic ramping of parameters in the many-body localised XXZ model, (ii) heating in the periodically-driven transverse-field Ising model in a parallel field, and (iii) quantised light-atom interactions: recovering the periodically-driven atom in the semi-classical limit of a static Hamiltonian. 

THIS IS A HANDS-ON SEMINAR:
 
1) we would like to ask the interested participants to BRING along their LAPTOP computers in order to install the package and interactively learn how to run and use the example codes we have prepared. 

2) For first-time users of Python, we recommend that you INSTALL Anaconda for Python 2.7 on your computer BEFORE the seminar begins. It can be downloaded at https://www.continuum.io/downloads . Also, if you do not have an editor, we recommend that you download Sublime Text from https://www.sublimetext.com/3 .
